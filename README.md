# Network-Evolution

**Summary**: General social media model -- intended to predominately demonstrate evolution over time (i.e new users, connections, sharing, etc.) <br>

**Motivations**: This project found its start during my honors thesis work (which I cannot _yet_ post publicly) in which I examined the political impacts of social networks. Along the way, I become curious as to the structural incentives and favoring of the systems themselves, and figured I'd investigate the manner in which users, content, and connections evolve over time. Hopefully the (ever-updating) result sheds some light on these questions. <br>
